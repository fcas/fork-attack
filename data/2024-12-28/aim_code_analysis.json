            "help": "# Binding a socket to all network interfaces\nSockets can be used to communicate with other machines on a network. You can use the (IP address, port) pair to define the access restrictions for the socket you create. When using the built-in Python `socket` module (for instance, when building a message sender service or an FTP server data transmitter), one has to bind the port to some interface. When you bind the port to all interfaces using `0.0.0.0` as the IP address, you essentially allow it to accept connections from any IPv4 address provided that it can get to the socket via routing. Binding to all interfaces is therefore associated with security risks.\n\n\n## Recommendation\nBind your service incoming traffic only to a dedicated interface. If you need to bind more than one interface using the built-in `socket` module, create multiple sockets (instead of binding to one socket to all interfaces).\n\n\n## Example\nIn this example, two sockets are insecure because they are bound to all interfaces; one through the `0.0.0.0` notation and another one through an empty string `''`.\n\n\n```python\nimport socket\n\n# binds to all interfaces, insecure\ns = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)\ns.bind(('0.0.0.0', 31137))\n\n# binds to all interfaces, insecure\ns = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)\ns.bind(('', 4040))\n\n# binds only to a dedicated interface, secure\ns = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)\ns.bind(('84.68.10.12', 8080))\n\n```\n\n## References\n* Python reference: [ Socket families](https://docs.python.org/3/library/socket.html#socket-families).\n* Python reference: [ Socket Programming HOWTO](https://docs.python.org/3.7/howto/sockets.html).\n* Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures: [ CVE-2018-1281 Detail](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-1281).\n* Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-200](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/200.html).\n",

            "help": "# Incomplete string escaping or encoding\nSanitizing untrusted input is a common technique for preventing injection attacks such as SQL injection or cross-site scripting. Usually, this is done by escaping meta-characters such as quotes in a domain-specific way so that they are treated as normal characters.\n\nHowever, directly using the string `replace` method to perform escaping is notoriously error-prone. Common mistakes include only replacing the first occurrence of a meta-character, or backslash-escaping various meta-characters but not the backslash itself.\n\nIn the former case, later meta-characters are left undisturbed and can be used to subvert the sanitization. In the latter case, preceding a meta-character with a backslash leads to the backslash being escaped, but the meta-character appearing un-escaped, which again makes the sanitization ineffective.\n\nEven if the escaped string is not used in a security-critical context, incomplete escaping may still have undesirable effects, such as badly rendered or confusing output.\n\n\n## Recommendation\nUse a (well-tested) sanitization library if at all possible. These libraries are much more likely to handle corner cases correctly than a custom implementation.\n\nAn even safer alternative is to design the application so that sanitization is not needed, for instance by using prepared statements for SQL queries.\n\nOtherwise, make sure to use a regular expression with the `g` flag to ensure that all occurrences are replaced, and remember to escape backslashes if applicable.\n\n\n## Example\nFor example, assume that we want to embed a user-controlled string `accountNumber` into a SQL query as part of a string literal. To avoid SQL injection, we need to ensure that the string does not contain un-escaped single-quote characters. The following function attempts to ensure this by doubling single quotes, and thereby escaping them:\n\n\n```javascript\nfunction escapeQuotes(s) {\n  return s.replace(\"'\", \"''\");\n}\n\n```\nAs written, this sanitizer is ineffective: if the first argument to `replace` is a string literal (as in this case), only the *first* occurrence of that string is replaced.\n\nAs mentioned above, the function `escapeQuotes` should be replaced with a purpose-built sanitization library, such as the npm module `sqlstring`. Many other sanitization libraries are available from npm and other sources.\n\nIf this is not an option, `escapeQuotes` should be rewritten to use a regular expression with the `g` (\"global\") flag instead:\n\n\n```javascript\nfunction escapeQuotes(s) {\n  return s.replace(/'/g, \"''\");\n}\n\n```\nNote that it is very important to include the global flag: `s.replace(/'/, \"''\")` *without* the global flag is equivalent to the first example above and only replaces the first quote.\n\n\n## References\n* OWASP Top 10: [A1 Injection](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Top_10-2017_A1-Injection).\n* npm: [sqlstring](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sqlstring) package.\n* Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-20](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/20.html).\n* Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-80](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/80.html).\n* Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-116](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/116.html).\n",

            "help": "# Overly permissive regular expression range\nIt's easy to write a regular expression range that matches a wider range of characters than you intended. For example, `/[a-zA-z]/` matches all lowercase and all uppercase letters, as you would expect, but it also matches the characters: `` [ \\ ] ^ _ ` ``.\n\nAnother common problem is failing to escape the dash character in a regular expression. An unescaped dash is interpreted as part of a range. For example, in the character class `[a-zA-Z0-9%=.,-_]` the last character range matches the 55 characters between `,` and `_` (both included), which overlaps with the range `[0-9]` and is clearly not intended by the writer.\n\n\n## Recommendation\nAvoid any confusion about which characters are included in the range by writing unambiguous regular expressions. Always check that character ranges match only the expected characters.\n\n\n## Example\nThe following example code is intended to check whether a string is a valid 6 digit hex color.\n\n```javascript\n\nfunction isValidHexColor(color) {\n    return /^#[0-9a-fA-f]{6}$/i.test(color);\n}\n\n```\nHowever, the `A-f` range is overly large and matches every uppercase character. It would parse a \"color\" like `#XXYYZZ` as valid.\n\nThe fix is to use an uppercase `A-F` range instead.\n\n```javascript\n\nfunction isValidHexColor(color) {\n    return /^#[0-9A-F]{6}$/i.test(color);\n}\n\n```\n\n## References\n* GitHub Advisory Database: [CVE-2021-42740: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a Command in Shell-quote](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-g4rg-993r-mgx7)\n* wh0.github.io: [Exploiting CVE-2021-42740](https://wh0.github.io/2021/10/28/shell-quote-rce-exploiting.html)\n* Yosuke Ota: [no-obscure-range](https://ota-meshi.github.io/eslint-plugin-regexp/rules/no-obscure-range.html)\n* Paul Boyd: [The regex \\[,-.\\]](https://pboyd.io/posts/comma-dash-dot/)\n* Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-20](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/20.html).\n",

            "help": "# Incomplete URL substring sanitization\nSanitizing untrusted URLs is an important technique for preventing attacks such as request forgeries and malicious redirections. Usually, this is done by checking that the host of a URL is in a set of allowed hosts.\n\nHowever, treating the URL as a string and checking if one of the allowed hosts is a substring of the URL is very prone to errors. Malicious URLs can bypass such security checks by embedding one of the allowed hosts in an unexpected location.\n\nEven if the substring check is not used in a security-critical context, the incomplete check may still cause undesirable behaviors when the check succeeds accidentally.\n\n\n## Recommendation\nParse a URL before performing a check on its host value, and ensure that the check handles arbitrary subdomain sequences correctly.\n\n\n## Example\nThe following example code checks that a URL redirection will reach the `example.com` domain, or one of its subdomains, and not some malicious site.\n\n\n```javascript\napp.get('/some/path', function(req, res) {\n    let url = req.param(\"url\");\n    // BAD: the host of `url` may be controlled by an attacker\n    if (url.includes(\"example.com\")) {\n        res.redirect(url);\n    }\n});\n\n```\nThe substring check is, however, easy to bypass. For example by embedding `example.com` in the path component: `http://evil-example.net/example.com`, or in the query string component: `http://evil-example.net/?x=example.com`. Address these shortcomings by checking the host of the parsed URL instead:\n\n\n```javascript\napp.get('/some/path', function(req, res) {\n    let url = req.param(\"url\"),\n        host = urlLib.parse(url).host;\n    // BAD: the host of `url` may be controlled by an attacker\n    if (host.includes(\"example.com\")) {\n        res.redirect(url);\n    }\n});\n\n```\nThis is still not a sufficient check as the following URLs bypass it: `http://evil-example.com` `http://example.com.evil-example.net`. Instead, use an explicit whitelist of allowed hosts to make the redirect secure:\n\n\n```javascript\napp.get('/some/path', function(req, res) {\n    let url = req.param('url'),\n        host = urlLib.parse(url).host;\n    // GOOD: the host of `url` can not be controlled by an attacker\n    let allowedHosts = [\n        'example.com',\n        'beta.example.com',\n        'www.example.com'\n    ];\n    if (allowedHosts.includes(host)) {\n        res.redirect(url);\n    }\n});\n\n```\n\n## References\n* OWASP: [SSRF](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Server_Side_Request_Forgery)\n* OWASP: [XSS Unvalidated Redirects and Forwards Cheat Sheet](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Unvalidated_Redirects_and_Forwards_Cheat_Sheet.html).\n* Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-20](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/20.html).\n",
