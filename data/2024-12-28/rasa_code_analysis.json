            "help": "# Insecure temporary file\nFunctions that create temporary file names (such as `tempfile.mktemp` and `os.tempnam`) are fundamentally insecure, as they do not ensure exclusive access to a file with the temporary name they return. The file name returned by these functions is guaranteed to be unique on creation but the file must be opened in a separate operation. There is no guarantee that the creation and open operations will happen atomically. This provides an opportunity for an attacker to interfere with the file before it is opened.\n\nNote that `mktemp` has been deprecated since Python 2.3.\n\n\n## Recommendation\nReplace the use of `mktemp` with some of the more secure functions in the `tempfile` module, such as `TemporaryFile`. If the file is intended to be accessed from other processes, consider using the `NamedTemporaryFile` function.\n\n\n## Example\nThe following piece of code opens a temporary file and writes a set of results to it. Because the file name is created using `mktemp`, another process may access this file before it is opened using `open`.\n\n\n```python\nfrom tempfile import mktemp\n\ndef write_results(results):\n    filename = mktemp()\n    with open(filename, \"w+\") as f:\n        f.write(results)\n    print(\"Results written to\", filename)\n\n```\nBy changing the code to use `NamedTemporaryFile` instead, the file is opened immediately.\n\n\n```python\nfrom tempfile import NamedTemporaryFile\n\ndef write_results(results):\n    with NamedTemporaryFile(mode=\"w+\", delete=False) as f:\n        f.write(results)\n    print(\"Results written to\", f.name)\n\n```\n\n## References\n* Python Standard Library: [tempfile.mktemp](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tempfile.html#tempfile.mktemp).\n* Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-377](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/377.html).\n",

For example, in the character class `[a-zA-Z0-9%=.,-_]` the last character range matches the 55 characters between `,` and `_` (both included), which overlaps with the range `[0-9]` and is clearly not intended by the writer.\n\n\n## Recommendation\nAvoid any confusion about which characters are included in the range by writing unambiguous regular expressions. Always check that character ranges match only the expected characters.\n\n\n## Example\nThe following example code is intended to check whether a string is a valid 6 digit hex color.\n\n```python\n\nimport re\ndef is_valid_hex_color(color):\n    return re.match(r'^#[0-9a-fA-f]{6}$', color) is not None\n\n```\nHowever, the `A-f` range is overly large and matches every uppercase character. It would parse a \"color\" like `#XXYYZZ` as valid.\n\nThe fix is to use an uppercase `A-F` range instead.\n\n```python\n\nimport re\ndef is_valid_hex_color(color):\n    return re.match(r'^#[0-9a-fA-F]{6}$', color) is not None\n\n```\n\n## References\n* GitHub Advisory Database: [CVE-2021-42740: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a Command in Shell-quote](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-g4rg-993r-mgx7)\n* wh0.github.io: [Exploiting CVE-2021-42740](https://wh0.github.io/2021/10/28/shell-quote-rce-exploiting.html)\n* Yosuke Ota: [no-obscure-range](https://ota-meshi.github.io/eslint-plugin-regexp/rules/no-obscure-range.html)\n* Paul Boyd: [The regex \\[,-.\\]](https://pboyd.io/posts/comma-dash-dot/)\n* Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-20](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/20.html).\n",
