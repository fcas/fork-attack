Since most objects inherit from the compromised `Object.prototype`, the attacker can use this to tamper with the application logic, and often escalate to remote code execution or cross-site scripting.\n\nOne way to cause prototype pollution is through use of an unsafe *merge* or *extend* function to recursively copy properties from one object to another, or through the use of a *deep assignment* function to assign to an unverified chain of property names. Such a function has the potential to modify any object reachable from the destination object, and the built-in `Object.prototype` is usually reachable through the special properties `__proto__` and `constructor.prototype`.\n\n\n## Recommendation\nThe most effective place to guard against this is in the function that performs the recursive copy or deep assignment.\n\nOnly merge or assign a property recursively when it is an own property of the *destination* object. Alternatively, block the property names `__proto__` and `constructor` from being merged or assigned to.\n\n\n## Example\nThis function recursively copies properties from `src` to `dst`:\n\n\n```javascript\nfunction merge(dst, src) {\n    for (let key in src) {\n        if (!src.hasOwnProperty(key)) continue;\n        if (isObject(dst[key])) {\n            merge(dst[key], src[key]);\n        } else {\n            dst[key] = src[key];\n        }\n    }\n}\n\n```\nHowever, if `src` is the object `{\"__proto__\": {\"isAdmin\": true}}`, it will inject the property `isAdmin: true` in `Object.prototype`.\n\nThe issue can be fixed by ensuring that only own properties of the destination object are merged recursively:\n\n\n```javascript\nfunction merge(dst, src) {\n    for (let key in src) {\n        if (!src.hasOwnProperty(key)) continue;\n        if (dst.hasOwnProperty(key) && isObject(dst[key])) {\n            merge(dst[key], src[key]);\n        } else {\n            dst[key] = src[key];\n        }\n    }\n}\n\n```\nAlternatively, block the `__proto__` and `constructor` properties:\n\n\n```javascript\nfunction merge(dst, src) {\n    for (let key in src) {\n        if (!src.hasOwnProperty(key)) continue;\n        if (key === \"__proto__\" || key === \"constructor\") continue;\n        if (isObject(dst[key])) {\n            merge(dst[key], src[key]);\n        } else {\n            dst[key] = src[key];\n        }\n    }\n}\n\n```\n\n## References\n* Prototype pollution attacks: [lodash](https://hackerone.com/reports/380873), [jQuery](https://hackerone.com/reports/454365), [extend](https://hackerone.com/reports/381185), [just-extend](https://hackerone.com/reports/430291), [merge.recursive](https://hackerone.com/reports/381194).\n* Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-78](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/78.html).\n* Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-79](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/79.html).\n* Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-94](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/94.html).\n* Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-400](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/400.html).\n* Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-471](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/471.html).\n* Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-915](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/915.html).\n",

            "help": "# Incomplete string escaping or encoding\nSanitizing untrusted input is a common technique for preventing injection attacks such as SQL injection or cross-site scripting. Usually, this is done by escaping meta-characters such as quotes in a domain-specific way so that they are treated as normal characters.\n\nHowever, directly using the string `replace` method to perform escaping is notoriously error-prone. Common mistakes include only replacing the first occurrence of a meta-character, or backslash-escaping various meta-characters but not the backslash itself.\n\nIn the former case, later meta-characters are left undisturbed and can be used to subvert the sanitization. In the latter case, preceding a meta-character with a backslash leads to the backslash being escaped, but the meta-character appearing un-escaped, which again makes the sanitization ineffective.\n\nEven if the escaped string is not used in a security-critical context, incomplete escaping may still have undesirable effects, such as badly rendered or confusing output.\n\n\n## Recommendation\nUse a (well-tested) sanitization library if at all possible. These libraries are much more likely to handle corner cases correctly than a custom implementation.\n\nAn even safer alternative is to design the application so that sanitization is not needed, for instance by using prepared statements for SQL queries.\n\nOtherwise, make sure to use a regular expression with the `g` flag to ensure that all occurrences are replaced, and remember to escape backslashes if applicable.\n\n\n## Example\nFor example, assume that we want to embed a user-controlled string `accountNumber` into a SQL query as part of a string literal. To avoid SQL injection, we need to ensure that the string does not contain un-escaped single-quote characters. The following function attempts to ensure this by doubling single quotes, and thereby escaping them:\n\n\n```javascript\nfunction escapeQuotes(s) {\n  return s.replace(\"'\", \"''\");\n}\n\n```\nAs written, this sanitizer is ineffective: if the first argument to `replace` is a string literal (as in this case), only the *first* occurrence of that string is replaced.\n\nAs mentioned above, the function `escapeQuotes` should be replaced with a purpose-built sanitization library, such as the npm module `sqlstring`. Many other sanitization libraries are available from npm and other sources.\n\nIf this is not an option, `escapeQuotes` should be rewritten to use a regular expression with the `g` (\"global\") flag instead:\n\n\n```javascript\nfunction escapeQuotes(s) {\n  return s.replace(/'/g, \"''\");\n}\n\n```\nNote that it is very important to include the global flag: `s.replace(/'/, \"''\")` *without* the global flag is equivalent to the first example above and only replaces the first quote.\n\n\n## References\n* OWASP Top 10: [A1 Injection](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Top_10-2017_A1-Injection).\n* npm: [sqlstring](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sqlstring) package.\n* Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-20](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/20.html).\n* Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-80](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/80.html).\n* Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-116](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/116.html).\n",

            "help": "# Incomplete string escaping or encoding\nSanitizing untrusted input is a common technique for preventing injection attacks such as SQL injection or cross-site scripting. Usually, this is done by escaping meta-characters such as quotes in a domain-specific way so that they are treated as normal characters.\n\nHowever, directly using the string `replace` method to perform escaping is notoriously error-prone. Common mistakes include only replacing the first occurrence of a meta-character, or backslash-escaping various meta-characters but not the backslash itself.\n\nIn the former case, later meta-characters are left undisturbed and can be used to subvert the sanitization. In the latter case, preceding a meta-character with a backslash leads to the backslash being escaped, but the meta-character appearing un-escaped, which again makes the sanitization ineffective.\n\nEven if the escaped string is not used in a security-critical context, incomplete escaping may still have undesirable effects, such as badly rendered or confusing output.\n\n\n## Recommendation\nUse a (well-tested) sanitization library if at all possible. These libraries are much more likely to handle corner cases correctly than a custom implementation.\n\nAn even safer alternative is to design the application so that sanitization is not needed, for instance by using prepared statements for SQL queries.\n\nOtherwise, make sure to use a regular expression with the `g` flag to ensure that all occurrences are replaced, and remember to escape backslashes if applicable.\n\n\n## Example\nFor example, assume that we want to embed a user-controlled string `accountNumber` into a SQL query as part of a string literal. To avoid SQL injection, we need to ensure that the string does not contain un-escaped single-quote characters. The following function attempts to ensure this by doubling single quotes, and thereby escaping them:\n\n\n```javascript\nfunction escapeQuotes(s) {\n  return s.replace(\"'\", \"''\");\n}\n\n```\nAs written, this sanitizer is ineffective: if the first argument to `replace` is a string literal (as in this case), only the *first* occurrence of that string is replaced.\n\nAs mentioned above, the function `escapeQuotes` should be replaced with a purpose-built sanitization library, such as the npm module `sqlstring`. Many other sanitization libraries are available from npm and other sources.\n\nIf this is not an option, `escapeQuotes` should be rewritten to use a regular expression with the `g` (\"global\") flag instead:\n\n\n```javascript\nfunction escapeQuotes(s) {\n  return s.replace(/'/g, \"''\");\n}\n\n```\nNote that it is very important to include the global flag: `s.replace(/'/, \"''\")` *without* the global flag is equivalent to the first example above and only replaces the first quote.\n\n\n## References\n* OWASP Top 10: [A1 Injection](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Top_10-2017_A1-Injection).\n* npm: [sqlstring](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sqlstring) package.\n* Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-20](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/20.html).\n* Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-80](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/80.html).\n* Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-116](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/116.html).\n",

            "help": "# Clear-text storage of sensitive information\nSensitive information that is stored unencrypted is accessible to an attacker who gains access to the storage. This is particularly important for cookies, which are stored on the machine of the end-user.\n\n\n## Recommendation\nEnsure that sensitive information is always encrypted before being stored. If possible, avoid placing sensitive information in cookies altogether. Instead, prefer storing, in the cookie, a key that can be used to look up the sensitive information.\n\nIn general, decrypt sensitive information only at the point where it is necessary for it to be used in cleartext.\n\nBe aware that external processes often store the `standard out` and `standard error` streams of the application, causing logged sensitive information to be stored as well.\n\n\n## Example\nThe following example code stores user credentials (in this case, their password) in a cookie in plain text:\n\n\n```python\nfrom flask import Flask, make_response, request\n\napp = Flask(\"Leak password\")\n\n@app.route('/')\ndef index():\n    password = request.args.get(\"password\")\n    resp = make_response(render_template(...))\n    resp.set_cookie(\"password\", password)\n    return resp\n\n```\nInstead, the credentials should be encrypted, for instance by using the `cryptography` module, or not stored at all.\n\n\n## References\n* M.

Accepting unknown host keys may leave the connection open to man-in-the-middle attacks.\n\n\n## Recommendation\nDo not accept unknown host keys. In particular, do not set the default missing host key policy for the Paramiko library to either `AutoAddPolicy` or `WarningPolicy`. Both of these policies continue even when the host key is unknown. The default setting of `RejectPolicy` is secure because it throws an exception when it encounters an unknown host key.\n\n\n## Example\nThe following example shows two ways of opening an SSH connection to `example.com`. The first function sets the missing host key policy to `AutoAddPolicy`. If the host key verification fails, the client will continue to interact with the server, even though the connection may be compromised. The second function sets the host key policy to `RejectPolicy`, and will throw an exception if the host key verification fails.\n\n\n```python\nfrom paramiko.client import SSHClient, AutoAddPolicy, RejectPolicy\n\ndef unsafe_connect():\n    client = SSHClient()\n    client.set_missing_host_key_policy(AutoAddPolicy)\n    client.connect(\"example.com\")\n\n    # ... interaction with server\n\n    client.close()\n\ndef safe_connect():\n    client = SSHClient()\n    client.set_missing_host_key_policy(RejectPolicy)\n    client.connect(\"example.com\")\n\n    # ... interaction with server\n\n    client.close()\n\n```\n\n## References\n* Paramiko documentation: [set_missing_host_key_policy](http://docs.paramiko.org/en/2.4/api/client.html?highlight=set_missing_host_key_policy#paramiko.client.SSHClient.set_missing_host_key_policy).\n* Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-295](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/295.html).\n",

            "help": "# Insecure temporary file\nFunctions that create temporary file names (such as `tempfile.mktemp` and `os.tempnam`) are fundamentally insecure, as they do not ensure exclusive access to a file with the temporary name they return. The file name returned by these functions is guaranteed to be unique on creation but the file must be opened in a separate operation. There is no guarantee that the creation and open operations will happen atomically. This provides an opportunity for an attacker to interfere with the file before it is opened.\n\nNote that `mktemp` has been deprecated since Python 2.3.\n\n\n## Recommendation\nReplace the use of `mktemp` with some of the more secure functions in the `tempfile` module, such as `TemporaryFile`. If the file is intended to be accessed from other processes, consider using the `NamedTemporaryFile` function.\n\n\n## Example\nThe following piece of code opens a temporary file and writes a set of results to it. Because the file name is created using `mktemp`, another process may access this file before it is opened using `open`.\n\n\n```python\nfrom tempfile import mktemp\n\ndef write_results(results):\n    filename = mktemp()\n    with open(filename, \"w+\") as f:\n        f.write(results)\n    print(\"Results written to\", filename)\n\n```\nBy changing the code to use `NamedTemporaryFile` instead, the file is opened immediately.\n\n\n```python\nfrom tempfile import NamedTemporaryFile\n\ndef write_results(results):\n    with NamedTemporaryFile(mode=\"w+\", delete=False) as f:\n        f.write(results)\n    print(\"Results written to\", f.name)\n\n```\n\n## References\n* Python Standard Library: [tempfile.mktemp](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tempfile.html#tempfile.mktemp).\n* Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-377](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/377.html).\n",

The worst-case time complexity of such an automaton can be polynomial or even exponential, meaning that for strings of a certain shape, increasing the input length by ten characters may make the automaton about 1000 times slower.\n\nTypically, a regular expression is affected by this problem if it contains a repetition of the form `r*` or `r+` where the sub-expression `r` is ambiguous in the sense that it can match some string in multiple ways. More information about the precise circumstances can be found in the references.\n\n\n## Recommendation\nModify the regular expression to remove the ambiguity, or ensure that the strings matched with the regular expression are short enough that the time-complexity does not matter.\n\n\n## Example\nConsider this regular expression:\n\n```python\n\n^_(__|.)+_$\n```\nIts sub-expression `\"(__|.)+?\"` can match the string `\"__\"` either by the first alternative `\"__\"` to the left of the `\"|\"` operator, or by two repetitions of the second alternative `\".\"` to the right. Thus, a string consisting of an odd number of underscores followed by some other character will cause the regular expression engine to run for an exponential amount of time before rejecting the input.\n\nThis problem can be avoided by rewriting the regular expression to remove the ambiguity between the two branches of the alternative inside the repetition:\n\n```python\n\n^_(__|[^_])+_$\n```\n\n## References\n* OWASP: [Regular expression Denial of Service - ReDoS](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Regular_expression_Denial_of_Service_-_ReDoS).\n* Wikipedia: [ReDoS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ReDoS).\n* Wikipedia: [Time complexity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_complexity).\n* James Kirrage, Asiri Rathnayake, Hayo Thielecke: [Static Analysis for Regular Expression Denial-of-Service Attack](https://arxiv.org/abs/1301.0849).\n* Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-1333](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/1333.html).\n* Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-730](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/730.html).\n* Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-400](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/400.html).\n",

All versions of SSL, and TLS versions 1.0 and 1.1 are known to be vulnerable to attacks. Using TLS 1.2 or above is strongly recommended.\n\n\n## Example\nThe following code shows a variety of ways of setting up a connection using SSL or TLS.

They are all insecure because of the version specified.\n\n\n```python\nimport ssl\nimport socket\n\n# Using the deprecated ssl.wrap_socket method\nssl.wrap_socket(socket.socket(), ssl_version=ssl.PROTOCOL_SSLv2)\n\n# Using SSLContext\ncontext = ssl.SSLContext(ssl_version=ssl.PROTOCOL_SSLv3)\n\n# Using pyOpenSSL\n\nfrom pyOpenSSL import SSL\n\ncontext = SSL.Context(SSL.TLSv1_METHOD)\n\n\n\n```\nAll cases should be updated to use a secure protocol, such as `PROTOCOL_TLSv1_2`.\n\nNote that `ssl.wrap_socket` has been deprecated in Python 3.7. The recommended alternatives are:\n\n* `ssl.SSLContext` - supported in Python 2.7.9, 3.2, and later versions\n* `ssl.create_default_context` - a convenience function, supported in Python 3.4 and later versions.\nEven when you use these alternatives, you should ensure that a safe protocol is used. The following code illustrates how to use flags (available since Python 3.2) or the \\`minimum_version\\` field (favored since Python 3.7) to restrict the protocols accepted when creating a connection.\n\n\n```python\nimport ssl\n\n# Using flags to restrict the protocol\ncontext = ssl.SSLContext()\ncontext.options |= ssl.OP_NO_TLSv1 | ssl.OP_NO_TLSv1_1\n\n# Declaring a minimum version to restrict the protocol\ncontext = ssl.create_default_context()\ncontext.minimum_version = ssl.TLSVersion.TLSv1_2\n\n```\n\n## References\n* Wikipedia: [ Transport Layer Security](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security).\n* Python 3 documentation: [ class ssl.SSLContext](https://docs.python.org/3/library/ssl.html#ssl.SSLContext).\n* Python 3 documentation: [ ssl.wrap_socket](https://docs.python.org/3/library/ssl.html#ssl.wrap_socket).\n* Python 3 documentation: [ notes on context creation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/ssl.html#functions-constants-and-exceptions).\n* Python 3 documentation: [ notes on security considerations](https://docs.python.org/3/library/ssl.html#ssl-security).\n* pyOpenSSL documentation: [ An interface to the SSL-specific parts of OpenSSL](https://pyopenssl.org/en/stable/api/ssl.html).\n* Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-327](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/327.html).\n",

            "help": "# Bad HTML filtering regexp\nIt is possible to match some single HTML tags using regular expressions (parsing general HTML using regular expressions is impossible). However, if the regular expression is not written well it might be possible to circumvent it, which can lead to cross-site scripting or other security issues.\n\nSome of these mistakes are caused by browsers having very forgiving HTML parsers, and will often render invalid HTML containing syntax errors. Regular expressions that attempt to match HTML should also recognize tags containing such syntax errors.\n\n\n## Recommendation\nUse a well-tested sanitization or parser library if at all possible. These libraries are much more likely to handle corner cases correctly than a custom implementation.\n\n\n## Example\nThe following example attempts to filters out all `<script>` tags.\n\n\n```python\nimport re\n\ndef filterScriptTags(content): \n    oldContent = \"\"\n    while oldContent != content:\n        oldContent = content\n        content = re.sub(r'<script.*?>.*?</script>', '', content, flags= re.DOTALL | re.IGNORECASE)\n    return content\n```\nThe above sanitizer does not filter out all `<script>` tags. Browsers will not only accept `</script>` as script end tags, but also tags such as `</script foo=\"bar\">` even though it is a parser error. This means that an attack string such as `<script>alert(1)</script foo=\"bar\">` will not be filtered by the function, and `alert(1)` will be executed by a browser if the string is rendered as HTML.\n\nOther corner cases include that HTML comments can end with `--!>`, and that HTML tag names can contain upper case characters.\n\n\n## References\n* Securitum: [The Curious Case of Copy &amp; Paste](https://research.securitum.com/the-curious-case-of-copy-paste/).\n* stackoverflow.com: [You can't parse \\[X\\]HTML with regex](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1732348/regex-match-open-tags-except-xhtml-self-contained-tags#answer-1732454).\n* HTML Standard: [Comment end bang state](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/parsing.html#comment-end-bang-state).\n* stackoverflow.com: [Why aren't browsers strict about HTML?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/25559999/why-arent-browsers-strict-about-html).\n* Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-116](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/116.html).\n* Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-20](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/20.html).\n* Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-185](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/185.html).\n* Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-186](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/186.html).\n",

            "help": "# Overly permissive regular expression range\nIt's easy to write a regular expression range that matches a wider range of characters than you intended. For example, `/[a-zA-z]/` matches all lowercase and all uppercase letters, as you would expect, but it also matches the characters: `` [ \\ ] ^ _ ` ``.\n\nAnother common problem is failing to escape the dash character in a regular expression. An unescaped dash is interpreted as part of a range. For example, in the character class `[a-zA-Z0-9%=.,-_]` the last character range matches the 55 characters between `,` and `_` (both included), which overlaps with the range `[0-9]` and is clearly not intended by the writer.\n\n\n## Recommendation\nAvoid any confusion about which characters are included in the range by writing unambiguous regular expressions. Always check that character ranges match only the expected characters.\n\n\n## Example\nThe following example code is intended to check whether a string is a valid 6 digit hex color.\n\n```python\n\nimport re\ndef is_valid_hex_color(color):\n    return re.match(r'^#[0-9a-fA-f]{6}$', color) is not None\n\n```\nHowever, the `A-f` range is overly large and matches every uppercase character. It would parse a \"color\" like `#XXYYZZ` as valid.\n\nThe fix is to use an uppercase `A-F` range instead.\n\n```python\n\nimport re\ndef is_valid_hex_color(color):\n    return re.match(r'^#[0-9a-fA-F]{6}$', color) is not None\n\n```\n\n## References\n* GitHub Advisory Database: [CVE-2021-42740: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a Command in Shell-quote](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-g4rg-993r-mgx7)\n* wh0.github.io: [Exploiting CVE-2021-42740](https://wh0.github.io/2021/10/28/shell-quote-rce-exploiting.html)\n* Yosuke Ota: [no-obscure-range](https://ota-meshi.github.io/eslint-plugin-regexp/rules/no-obscure-range.html)\n* Paul Boyd: [The regex \\[,-.\\]](https://pboyd.io/posts/comma-dash-dot/)\n* Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-20](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/20.html).\n",

            "help": "# Incomplete URL substring sanitization\nSanitizing untrusted URLs is a common technique for preventing attacks such as request forgeries and malicious redirections. Usually, this is done by checking that the host of a URL is in a set of allowed hosts.\n\nHowever, treating the URL as a string and checking if one of the allowed hosts is a substring of the URL is very prone to errors. Malicious URLs can bypass such security checks by embedding one of the allowed hosts in an unexpected location.\n\nEven if the substring check is not used in a security-critical context, the incomplete check may still cause undesirable behaviors when the check succeeds accidentally.\n\n\n## Recommendation\nParse a URL before performing a check on its host value, and ensure that the check handles arbitrary subdomain sequences correctly.\n\n\n## Example\nThe following example code checks that a URL redirection will reach the `example.com` domain.\n\n\n```python\nfrom flask import Flask, request, redirect\nfrom urllib.parse import urlparse\n\napp = Flask(__name__)\n\n# Not safe, as \"evil-example.net/example.com\" would be accepted\n\n@app.route('/some/path/bad1')\ndef unsafe1(request):\n    target = request.args.get('target', '')\n    if \"example.com\" in target:\n        return redirect(target)\n\n# Not safe, as \"benign-looking-prefix-example.com\" would be accepted\n\n@app.route('/some/path/bad2')\ndef unsafe2(request):\n    target = request.args.get('target', '')\n    if target.endswith(\"example.com\"):\n        return redirect(target)\n\n\n\n#Simplest and safest approach is to use an allowlist\n\n@app.route('/some/path/good1')\ndef safe1(request):\n    allowlist = [\n        \"example.com/home\",\n        \"example.com/login\",\n    ]\n    target = request.args.get('target', '')\n    if target in allowlist:\n        return redirect(target)\n\n#More complex example allowing sub-domains.\n\n@app.route('/some/path/good2')\ndef safe2(request):\n    target = request.args.get('target', '')\n    host = urlparse(target).hostname\n    #Note the '.' preceding example.com\n    if host and host.endswith(\".example.com\"):\n        return redirect(target)\n\n\n```\nThe first two examples show unsafe checks that are easily bypassed. In `unsafe1` the attacker can simply add `example.com` anywhere in the url. For example, `http://evil-example.net/example.com`.\n\nIn `unsafe2` the attacker must use a hostname ending in `example.com`, but that is easy to do. For example, `http://benign-looking-prefix-example.com`.\n\nThe second two examples show safe checks. In `safe1`, an allowlist is used. Although fairly inflexible, this is easy to get right and is most likely to be safe.\n\nIn `safe2`, `urlparse` is used to parse the URL, then the hostname is checked to make sure it ends with `.example.com`.\n\n\n## References\n* OWASP: [SSRF](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Server_Side_Request_Forgery)\n* OWASP: [XSS Unvalidated Redirects and Forwards Cheat Sheet](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Unvalidated_Redirects_and_Forwards_Cheat_Sheet.html).\n* Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-20](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/20.html).\n",
