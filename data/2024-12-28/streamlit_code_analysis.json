            "help": "# Polynomial regular expression used on uncontrolled data\nSome regular expressions take a long time to match certain input strings to the point where the time it takes to match a string of length *n* is proportional to *n<sup>k</sup>* or even *2<sup>n</sup>*. Such regular expressions can negatively affect performance, or even allow a malicious user to perform a Denial of Service (\"DoS\") attack by crafting an expensive input string for the regular expression to match.\n\nThe regular expression engine provided by Python uses a backtracking non-deterministic finite automata to implement regular expression matching. While this approach is space-efficient and allows supporting advanced features like capture groups, it is not time-efficient in general. The worst-case time complexity of such an automaton can be polynomial or even exponential, meaning that for strings of a certain shape, increasing the input length by ten characters may make the automaton about 1000 times slower.\n\nTypically, a regular expression is affected by this problem if it contains a repetition of the form `r*` or `r+` where the sub-expression `r` is ambiguous in the sense that it can match some string in multiple ways. More information about the precise circumstances can be found in the references.\n\n\n## Recommendation\nModify the regular expression to remove the ambiguity, or ensure that the strings matched with the regular expression are short enough that the time-complexity does not matter.\n\n\n## Example\nConsider this use of a regular expression, which removes all leading and trailing whitespace in a string:\n\n```python\n\nre.sub(r\"^\\s+|\\s+$\", \"\", text) # BAD\n```\nThe sub-expression `\"\\s+$\"` will match the whitespace characters in `text` from left to right, but it can start matching anywhere within a whitespace sequence. This is problematic for strings that do **not** end with a whitespace character. Such a string will force the regular expression engine to process each whitespace sequence once per whitespace character in the sequence.\n\nThis ultimately means that the time cost of trimming a string is quadratic in the length of the string. So a string like `\"a b\"` will take milliseconds to process, but a similar string with a million spaces instead of just one will take several minutes.\n\nAvoid this problem by rewriting the regular expression to not contain the ambiguity about when to start matching whitespace sequences. For instance, by using a negative look-behind (`^\\s+|(?<!\\s)\\s+$`), or just by using the built-in strip method (`text.strip()`).\n\nNote that the sub-expression `\"^\\s+\"` is **not** problematic as the `^` anchor restricts when that sub-expression can start matching, and as the regular expression engine matches from left to right.\n\n\n## Example\nAs a similar, but slightly subtler problem, consider the regular expression that matches lines with numbers, possibly written using scientific notation:\n\n```python\n\n^0\\.\\d+E?\\d+$ # BAD\n```\nThe problem with this regular expression is in the sub-expression `\\d+E?\\d+` because the second `\\d+` can start matching digits anywhere after the first match of the first `\\d+` if there is no `E` in the input string.\n\nThis is problematic for strings that do **not** end with a digit. Such a string will force the regular expression engine to process each digit sequence once per digit in the sequence, again leading to a quadratic time complexity.\n\nTo make the processing faster, the regular expression should be rewritten such that the two `\\d+` sub-expressions do not have overlapping matches: `^0\\.\\d+(E\\d+)?$`.\n\n\n## Example\nSometimes it is unclear how a regular expression can be rewritten to avoid the problem. In such cases, it often suffices to limit the length of the input string. For instance, the following regular expression is used to match numbers, and on some non-number inputs it can have quadratic time complexity:\n\n```python\n\nmatch = re.search(r'^(\\+|-)?(\\d+|(\\d*\\.\\d*))?(E|e)?([-+])?(\\d+)?$', str) \n```\nIt is not immediately obvious how to rewrite this regular expression to avoid the problem. However, you can mitigate performance issues by limiting the length to 1000 characters, which will always finish in a reasonable amount of time.\n\n```python\n\nif len(str) > 1000:\n    raise ValueError(\"Input too long\")\n\nmatch = re.search(r'^(\\+|-)?(\\d+|(\\d*\\.\\d*))?(E|e)?([-+])?(\\d+)?$', str) \n```\n\n## References\n* OWASP: [Regular expression Denial of Service - ReDoS](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Regular_expression_Denial_of_Service_-_ReDoS).\n* Wikipedia: [ReDoS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ReDoS).\n* Wikipedia: [Time complexity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_complexity).\n* James Kirrage, Asiri Rathnayake, Hayo Thielecke: [Static Analysis for Regular Expression Denial-of-Service Attack](https://arxiv.org/abs/1301.0849).\n* Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-1333](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/1333.html).\n* Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-730](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/730.html).\n* Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-400](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/400.html).\n",

            "help": "# Uncontrolled data used in path expression\nAccessing files using paths constructed from user-controlled data can allow an attacker to access unexpected resources. This can result in sensitive information being revealed or deleted, or an attacker being able to influence behavior by modifying unexpected files.\n\n\n## Recommendation\nValidate user input before using it to construct a file path, either using an off-the-shelf library function like `werkzeug.utils.secure_filename`, or by performing custom validation.\n\nIdeally, follow these rules:\n\n* Do not allow more than a single \".\" character.\n* Do not allow directory separators such as \"/\" or \"\\\\\" (depending on the file system).\n* Do not rely on simply replacing problematic sequences such as \"../\". For example, after applying this filter to \".../...//\", the resulting string would still be \"../\".\n* Use an allowlist of known good patterns.\n\n## Example\nIn the first example, a file name is read from an HTTP request and then used to access a file. However, a malicious user could enter a file name that is an absolute path, such as `\"/etc/passwd\"`.\n\nIn the second example, it appears that the user is restricted to opening a file within the `\"user\"` home directory. However, a malicious user could enter a file name containing special characters. For example, the string `\"../../../etc/passwd\"` will result in the code reading the file located at `\"/server/static/images/../../../etc/passwd\"`, which is the system's password file. This file would then be sent back to the user, giving them access to all the system's passwords. Note that a user could also use an absolute path here, since the result of `os.path.join(\"/server/static/images/\", \"/etc/passwd\")` is `\"/etc/passwd\"`.\n\nIn the third example, the path used to access the file system is normalized *before* being checked against a known prefix. This ensures that regardless of the user input, the resulting path is safe.\n\n\n```python\nimport os.path\nfrom flask import Flask, request, abort\n\napp = Flask(__name__)\n\n@app.route(\"/user_picture1\")\ndef user_picture1():\n    filename = request.args.get('p')\n    # BAD: This could read any file on the file system\n    data = open(filename, 'rb').read()\n    return data\n\n@app.route(\"/user_picture2\")\ndef user_picture2():\n    base_path = '/server/static/images'\n    filename = request.args.get('p')\n    # BAD: This could still read any file on the file system\n    data = open(os.path.join(base_path, filename), 'rb').read()\n    return data\n\n@app.route(\"/user_picture3\")\ndef user_picture3():\n    base_path = '/server/static/images'\n    filename = request.args.get('p')\n    #GOOD -- Verify with normalised version of path\n    fullpath = os.path.normpath(os.path.join(base_path, filename))\n    if not fullpath.startswith(base_path):\n        raise Exception(\"not allowed\")\n    data = open(fullpath, 'rb').read()\n    return data\n\n```\n\n## References\n* OWASP: [Path Traversal](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/Path_Traversal).\n* npm: [werkzeug.utils.secure_filename](http://werkzeug.pocoo.org/docs/utils/#werkzeug.utils.secure_filename).\n* Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-22](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/22.html).\n* Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-23](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/23.html).\n* Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-36](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/36.html).\n* Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-73](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/73.html).\n* Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-99](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/99.html).\n",

Passwords should also have an unique salt applied before hashing, but that is not considered by this query.\n\nAs an example, both MD5 and SHA-1 are known to be vulnerable to collision attacks.\n\nSince it's OK to use a weak cryptographic hash function in a non-security context, this query only alerts when these are used to hash sensitive data (such as passwords, certificates, usernames).\n\nUse of broken or weak cryptographic algorithms that are not hashing algorithms, is handled by the `py/weak-cryptographic-algorithm` query.\n\n\n## Recommendation\nEnsure that you use a strong, modern cryptographic hash function:\n\n* such as Argon2, scrypt, bcrypt, or PBKDF2 for passwords and other data with limited input space.\n* such as SHA-2, or SHA-3 in other cases.\n\n## Example\nThe following example shows two functions for checking whether the hash of a certificate matches a known value -- to prevent tampering. The first function uses MD5 that is known to be vulnerable to collision attacks. The second function uses SHA-256 that is a strong cryptographic hashing function.\n\n\n```python\nimport hashlib\n\ndef certificate_matches_known_hash_bad(certificate, known_hash):\n    hash = hashlib.md5(certificate).hexdigest() # BAD\n    return hash == known_hash\n\ndef certificate_matches_known_hash_good(certificate, known_hash):\n    hash = hashlib.sha256(certificate).hexdigest() # GOOD\n    return hash == known_hash\n\n```\n\n## Example\nThe following example shows two functions for hashing passwords. The first function uses SHA-256 to hash passwords. Although SHA-256 is a strong cryptographic hash function, it is not suitable for password hashing since it is not computationally expensive.\n\n\n```python\nimport hashlib\n\ndef get_password_hash(password: str, salt: str):\n    return hashlib.sha256(password + salt).hexdigest() # BAD\n\n```\nThe second function uses Argon2 (through the `argon2-cffi` PyPI package), which is a strong password hashing algorithm (and includes a per-password salt by default).\n\n\n```python\nfrom argon2 import PasswordHasher\n\ndef get_initial_hash(password: str):\n    ph = PasswordHasher()\n    return ph.hash(password) # GOOD\n\ndef check_password(password: str, known_hash):\n    ph = PasswordHasher()\n    return ph.verify(known_hash, password) # GOOD\n\n```\n\n## References\n* OWASP: [Password Storage Cheat Sheet](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Password_Storage_Cheat_Sheet.html)\n* Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-327](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/327.html).\n* Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-328](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/328.html).\n* Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-916](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/916.html).\n",

            "help": "# Use of a broken or weak cryptographic hashing algorithm on sensitive data\nUsing a broken or weak cryptographic hash function can leave data vulnerable, and should not be used in security related code.\n\nA strong cryptographic hash function should be resistant to:\n\n* pre-image attacks: if you know a hash value `h(x)`, you should not be able to easily find the input `x`.\n* collision attacks: if you know a hash value `h(x)`, you should not be able to easily find a different input `y` with the same hash value `h(x) = h(y)`.\nIn cases with a limited input space, such as for passwords, the hash function also needs to be computationally expensive to be resistant to brute-force attacks. Passwords should also have an unique salt applied before hashing, but that is not considered by this query.\n\nAs an example, both MD5 and SHA-1 are known to be vulnerable to collision attacks.\n\nSince it's OK to use a weak cryptographic hash function in a non-security context, this query only alerts when these are used to hash sensitive data (such as passwords, certificates, usernames).\n\nUse of broken or weak cryptographic algorithms that are not hashing algorithms, is handled by the `py/weak-cryptographic-algorithm` query.\n\n\n## Recommendation\nEnsure that you use a strong, modern cryptographic hash function:\n\n* such as Argon2, scrypt, bcrypt, or PBKDF2 for passwords and other data with limited input space.\n* such as SHA-2, or SHA-3 in other cases.\n\n## Example\nThe following example shows two functions for checking whether the hash of a certificate matches a known value -- to prevent tampering. The first function uses MD5 that is known to be vulnerable to collision attacks. The second function uses SHA-256 that is a strong cryptographic hashing function.\n\n\n```python\nimport hashlib\n\ndef certificate_matches_known_hash_bad(certificate, known_hash):\n    hash = hashlib.md5(certificate).hexdigest() # BAD\n    return hash == known_hash\n\ndef certificate_matches_known_hash_good(certificate, known_hash):\n    hash = hashlib.sha256(certificate).hexdigest() # GOOD\n    return hash == known_hash\n\n```\n\n## Example\nThe following example shows two functions for hashing passwords. The first function uses SHA-256 to hash passwords. Although SHA-256 is a strong cryptographic hash function, it is not suitable for password hashing since it is not computationally expensive.\n\n\n```python\nimport hashlib\n\ndef get_password_hash(password: str, salt: str):\n    return hashlib.sha256(password + salt).hexdigest() # BAD\n\n```\nThe second function uses Argon2 (through the `argon2-cffi` PyPI package), which is a strong password hashing algorithm (and includes a per-password salt by default).\n\n\n```python\nfrom argon2 import PasswordHasher\n\ndef get_initial_hash(password: str):\n    ph = PasswordHasher()\n    return ph.hash(password) # GOOD\n\ndef check_password(password: str, known_hash):\n    ph = PasswordHasher()\n    return ph.verify(known_hash, password) # GOOD\n\n```\n\n## References\n* OWASP: [Password Storage Cheat Sheet](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Password_Storage_Cheat_Sheet.html)\n* Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-327](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/327.html).\n* Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-328](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/328.html).\n* Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-916](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/916.html).\n",

            "help": "# Incomplete URL substring sanitization\nSanitizing untrusted URLs is a common technique for preventing attacks such as request forgeries and malicious redirections. Usually, this is done by checking that the host of a URL is in a set of allowed hosts.\n\nHowever, treating the URL as a string and checking if one of the allowed hosts is a substring of the URL is very prone to errors. Malicious URLs can bypass such security checks by embedding one of the allowed hosts in an unexpected location.\n\nEven if the substring check is not used in a security-critical context, the incomplete check may still cause undesirable behaviors when the check succeeds accidentally.\n\n\n## Recommendation\nParse a URL before performing a check on its host value, and ensure that the check handles arbitrary subdomain sequences correctly.\n\n\n## Example\nThe following example code checks that a URL redirection will reach the `example.com` domain.\n\n\n```python\nfrom flask import Flask, request, redirect\nfrom urllib.parse import urlparse\n\napp = Flask(__name__)\n\n# Not safe, as \"evil-example.net/example.com\" would be accepted\n\n@app.route('/some/path/bad1')\ndef unsafe1(request):\n    target = request.args.get('target', '')\n    if \"example.com\" in target:\n        return redirect(target)\n\n# Not safe, as \"benign-looking-prefix-example.com\" would be accepted\n\n@app.route('/some/path/bad2')\ndef unsafe2(request):\n    target = request.args.get('target', '')\n    if target.endswith(\"example.com\"):\n        return redirect(target)\n\n\n\n#Simplest and safest approach is to use an allowlist\n\n@app.route('/some/path/good1')\ndef safe1(request):\n    allowlist = [\n        \"example.com/home\",\n        \"example.com/login\",\n    ]\n    target = request.args.get('target', '')\n    if target in allowlist:\n        return redirect(target)\n\n#More complex example allowing sub-domains.\n\n@app.route('/some/path/good2')\ndef safe2(request):\n    target = request.args.get('target', '')\n    host = urlparse(target).hostname\n    #Note the '.' preceding example.com\n    if host and host.endswith(\".example.com\"):\n        return redirect(target)\n\n\n```\nThe first two examples show unsafe checks that are easily bypassed. In `unsafe1` the attacker can simply add `example.com` anywhere in the url. For example, `http://evil-example.net/example.com`.\n\nIn `unsafe2` the attacker must use a hostname ending in `example.com`, but that is easy to do. For example, `http://benign-looking-prefix-example.com`.\n\nThe second two examples show safe checks. In `safe1`, an allowlist is used. Although fairly inflexible, this is easy to get right and is most likely to be safe.\n\nIn `safe2`, `urlparse` is used to parse the URL, then the hostname is checked to make sure it ends with `.example.com`.\n\n\n## References\n* OWASP: [SSRF](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Server_Side_Request_Forgery)\n* OWASP: [XSS Unvalidated Redirects and Forwards Cheat Sheet](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Unvalidated_Redirects_and_Forwards_Cheat_Sheet.html).\n* Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-20](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/20.html).\n",
