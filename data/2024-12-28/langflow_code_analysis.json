            "full_description": "When escaping special characters using a meta-character like backslash or ampersand, the meta-character has to be escaped first to avoid double-escaping, and conversely it has to be unescaped last to avoid double-unescaping.",
            "help": "# Double escaping or unescaping\nEscaping meta-characters in untrusted input is an important technique for preventing injection attacks such as cross-site scripting. One particular example of this is HTML entity encoding, where HTML special characters are replaced by HTML character entities to prevent them from being interpreted as HTML markup. For example, the less-than character is encoded as `&lt;` and the double-quote character as `&quot;`. Other examples include backslash-escaping for including untrusted data in string literals and percent-encoding for URI components.\n\nThe reverse process of replacing escape sequences with the characters they represent is known as unescaping.\n\nNote that the escape characters themselves (such as ampersand in the case of HTML encoding) play a special role during escaping and unescaping: they are themselves escaped, but also form part of the escaped representations of other characters. Hence care must be taken to avoid double escaping and unescaping: when escaping, the escape character must be escaped first, when unescaping it has to be unescaped last.\n\nIf used in the context of sanitization, double unescaping may render the sanitization ineffective. Even if it is not used in a security-critical context, it may still result in confusing or garbled output.\n\n\n## Recommendation\nUse a (well-tested) sanitization library if at all possible. These libraries are much more likely to handle corner cases correctly than a custom implementation. For URI encoding, you can use the standard `encodeURIComponent` and `decodeURIComponent` functions.\n\nOtherwise, make sure to always escape the escape character first, and unescape it last.\n\n\n## Example\nThe following example shows a pair of hand-written HTML encoding and decoding functions:\n\n\n```javascript\nmodule.exports.encode = function(s) {\n  return s.replace(/&/g, \"&amp;\")\n          .replace(/\"/g, \"&quot;\")\n          .replace(/'/g, \"&apos;\");\n};\n\nmodule.exports.decode = function(s) {\n  return s.replace(/&amp;/g, \"&\")\n          .replace(/&quot;/g, \"\\\"\")\n          .replace(/&apos;/g, \"'\");\n};\n\n```\nThe encoding function correctly handles ampersand before the other characters. For example, the string `me & \"you\"` is encoded as `me &amp; &quot;you&quot;`, and the string `&quot;` is encoded as `&amp;quot;`.\n\nThe decoding function, however, incorrectly decodes `&amp;` into `&` before handling the other characters. So while it correctly decodes the first example above, it decodes the second example (`&amp;quot;`) to `\"` (a single double quote), which is not correct.\n\nInstead, the decoding function should decode the ampersand last:\n\n\n```javascript\nmodule.exports.encode = function(s) {\n  return s.replace(/&/g, \"&amp;\")\n          .replace(/\"/g, \"&quot;\")\n          .replace(/'/g, \"&apos;\");\n};\n\nmodule.exports.decode = function(s) {\n  return s.replace(/&quot;/g, \"\\\"\")\n          .replace(/&apos;/g, \"'\")\n          .replace(/&amp;/g, \"&\");\n};\n\n```\n\n## References\n* OWASP Top 10: [A1 Injection](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Top_10-2017_A1-Injection).\n* npm: [html-entities](https://www.npmjs.com/package/html-entities) package.\n* npm: [js-string-escape](https://www.npmjs.com/package/js-string-escape) package.\n* Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-116](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/116.html).\n* Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-20](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/20.html).\n",

            "help": "# Polynomial regular expression used on uncontrolled data\nSome regular expressions take a long time to match certain input strings to the point where the time it takes to match a string of length *n* is proportional to *n<sup>k</sup>* or even *2<sup>n</sup>*. Such regular expressions can negatively affect performance, or even allow a malicious user to perform a Denial of Service (\"DoS\") attack by crafting an expensive input string for the regular expression to match.\n\nThe regular expression engine provided by Python uses a backtracking non-deterministic finite automata to implement regular expression matching. While this approach is space-efficient and allows supporting advanced features like capture groups, it is not time-efficient in general. The worst-case time complexity of such an automaton can be polynomial or even exponential, meaning that for strings of a certain shape, increasing the input length by ten characters may make the automaton about 1000 times slower.\n\nTypically, a regular expression is affected by this problem if it contains a repetition of the form `r*` or `r+` where the sub-expression `r` is ambiguous in the sense that it can match some string in multiple ways. More information about the precise circumstances can be found in the references.\n\n\n## Recommendation\nModify the regular expression to remove the ambiguity, or ensure that the strings matched with the regular expression are short enough that the time-complexity does not matter.\n\n\n## Example\nConsider this use of a regular expression, which removes all leading and trailing whitespace in a string:\n\n```python\n\nre.sub(r\"^\\s+|\\s+$\", \"\", text) # BAD\n```\nThe sub-expression `\"\\s+$\"` will match the whitespace characters in `text` from left to right, but it can start matching anywhere within a whitespace sequence. This is problematic for strings that do **not** end with a whitespace character. Such a string will force the regular expression engine to process each whitespace sequence once per whitespace character in the sequence.\n\nThis ultimately means that the time cost of trimming a string is quadratic in the length of the string. So a string like `\"a b\"` will take milliseconds to process, but a similar string with a million spaces instead of just one will take several minutes.\n\nAvoid this problem by rewriting the regular expression to not contain the ambiguity about when to start matching whitespace sequences. For instance, by using a negative look-behind (`^\\s+|(?<!\\s)\\s+$`), or just by using the built-in strip method (`text.strip()`).\n\nNote that the sub-expression `\"^\\s+\"` is **not** problematic as the `^` anchor restricts when that sub-expression can start matching, and as the regular expression engine matches from left to right.\n\n\n## Example\nAs a similar, but slightly subtler problem, consider the regular expression that matches lines with numbers, possibly written using scientific notation:\n\n```python\n\n^0\\.\\d+E?\\d+$ # BAD\n```\nThe problem with this regular expression is in the sub-expression `\\d+E?\\d+` because the second `\\d+` can start matching digits anywhere after the first match of the first `\\d+` if there is no `E` in the input string.\n\nThis is problematic for strings that do **not** end with a digit. Such a string will force the regular expression engine to process each digit sequence once per digit in the sequence, again leading to a quadratic time complexity.\n\nTo make the processing faster, the regular expression should be rewritten such that the two `\\d+` sub-expressions do not have overlapping matches: `^0\\.\\d+(E\\d+)?$`.\n\n\n## Example\nSometimes it is unclear how a regular expression can be rewritten to avoid the problem. In such cases, it often suffices to limit the length of the input string. For instance, the following regular expression is used to match numbers, and on some non-number inputs it can have quadratic time complexity:\n\n```python\n\nmatch = re.search(r'^(\\+|-)?(\\d+|(\\d*\\.\\d*))?(E|e)?([-+])?(\\d+)?$', str) \n```\nIt is not immediately obvious how to rewrite this regular expression to avoid the problem. However, you can mitigate performance issues by limiting the length to 1000 characters, which will always finish in a reasonable amount of time.\n\n```python\n\nif len(str) > 1000:\n    raise ValueError(\"Input too long\")\n\nmatch = re.search(r'^(\\+|-)?(\\d+|(\\d*\\.\\d*))?(E|e)?([-+])?(\\d+)?$', str) \n```\n\n## References\n* OWASP: [Regular expression Denial of Service - ReDoS](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Regular_expression_Denial_of_Service_-_ReDoS).\n* Wikipedia: [ReDoS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ReDoS).\n* Wikipedia: [Time complexity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_complexity).\n* James Kirrage, Asiri Rathnayake, Hayo Thielecke: [Static Analysis for Regular Expression Denial-of-Service Attack](https://arxiv.org/abs/1301.0849).\n* Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-1333](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/1333.html).\n* Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-730](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/730.html).\n* Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-400](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/400.html).\n",

This is particularly important for cookies, which are stored on the machine of the end-user.\n\n\n## Recommendation\nEnsure that sensitive information is always encrypted before being stored. If possible, avoid placing sensitive information in cookies altogether. Instead, prefer storing, in the cookie, a key that can be used to look up the sensitive information.\n\nIn general, decrypt sensitive information only at the point where it is necessary for it to be used in cleartext.\n\nBe aware that external processes often store the `standard out` and `standard error` streams of the application, causing logged sensitive information to be stored as well.\n\n\n## Example\nThe following example code stores user credentials (in this case, their password) in a cookie in plain text:\n\n\n```python\nfrom flask import Flask, make_response, request\n\napp = Flask(\"Leak password\")\n\n@app.route('/')\ndef index():\n    password = request.args.get(\"password\")\n    resp = make_response(render_template(...))\n    resp.set_cookie(\"password\", password)\n    return resp\n\n```\nInstead, the credentials should be encrypted, for instance by using the `cryptography` module, or not stored at all.\n\n\n## References\n* M.
