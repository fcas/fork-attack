For C/C++, check in the code from a trusted source and add a `README` on the specific version used (and the archive SHA hashes).\n\n- If your project is producing an application and the package manager supports lock files (e.g. `package-lock.json` for npm), make sure to check these in the source code as well. These files maintain signatures for the entire dependency tree and saves from future exploitation in case the package is compromised.\n\n- For Dockerfiles used in building and releasing your project, pin dependencies by hash. See [Dockerfile](https://github.com/ossf/scorecard/blob/main/cron/internal/worker/Dockerfile) for example. If you are using a manifest list to support builds across multiple architectures, you can pin to the manifest list hash instead of a single image hash. You can use a tool like [crane](https://github.com/google/go-containerregistry/blob/main/cmd/crane/README.md) to obtain the hash of the manifest list like in this [example](https://github.com/ossf/scorecard/issues/1773#issuecomment-1076699039).\n\n- For GitHub workflows used in building and releasing your project, pin dependencies by hash. See [main.yaml](https://github.com/ossf/scorecard/blob/f55b86d6627cc3717e3a0395e03305e81b9a09be/.github/workflows/main.yml#L27) for example. To determine the permissions needed for your workflows, you may use [StepSecurity's online tool](https://app.stepsecurity.io/secureworkflow/) by ticking the \"Pin actions to a full length commit SHA\". You may also tick the \"Restrict permissions for GITHUB_TOKEN\" to fix issues found by the Token-Permissions check.\n\n- To help update your dependencies after pinning them, use tools such as those listed for the dependency update tool check.\n\n\n\n**Severity**: Medium\n\n\n\n**Details**:\n\nRisk: `Medium` (possible compromised dependencies)\n\n\n\nThis check tries to determine if the project pins dependencies used during its build and release process.\n\nA \"pinned dependency\" is a dependency that is explicitly set to a specific hash instead of\n\nallowing a mutable version or range of versions. It\n\nis currently limited to repositories hosted on GitHub, and does not support\n\nother source hosting repositories (i.e., Forges).\n\n\n\nThe check works by looking for unpinned dependencies in Dockerfiles, shell scripts, and GitHub workflows\n\nwhich are used during the build and release process of a project.\n\nSpecial considerations for Go modules treat full semantic versions as pinned\n\ndue to how the Go tool verifies downloaded content against the hashes when anyone first downloaded the module.\n\n\n\nPinned dependencies reduce several security risks:\n\n\n\n  - They ensure that checking and deployment are all done with the same\n\n    software, reducing deployment risks, simplifying debugging, and enabling\n\n    reproducibility.\n\n  - They can help mitigate compromised dependencies from undermining the\n\n    security of the project (in the case where you've evaluated the pinned\n\n    dependency, you are confident it's not compromised, and a later version is\n\n    released that is compromised).\n\n  - They are one way to [counter dependency confusion (aka substitution) attacks](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/resources/3-ways-to-mitigate-risk-using-private-package-feeds/),\n\n    in which an application uses multiple feeds to acquire software packages (a\n\n    \"hybrid configuration\"), and attackers fool the user into using a malicious\n\n    package via a feed that was not expected for that package.\n\n\n\nHowever, pinning dependencies can inhibit software updates, either because of a\n\nsecurity vulnerability or because the pinned version is compromised. Mitigate\n\nthis risk by:\n\n\n\n  - using automated tools to notify applications when their dependencies are\n\n    outdated;\n\n  - quickly updating applications that do pin dependencies.\n\n\n\nFor projects hosted on GitHub, you can learn more about\n\ndependencies using the [GitHub dependency graph](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/supply-chain-security/understanding-your-software-supply-chain/about-the-dependency-graph).\n\n",

For C/C++, check in the code from a trusted source and add a `README` on the specific version used (and the archive SHA hashes).\n\n- If your project is producing an application and the package manager supports lock files (e.g. `package-lock.json` for npm), make sure to check these in the source code as well. These files maintain signatures for the entire dependency tree and saves from future exploitation in case the package is compromised.\n\n- For Dockerfiles used in building and releasing your project, pin dependencies by hash. See [Dockerfile](https://github.com/ossf/scorecard/blob/main/cron/internal/worker/Dockerfile) for example. If you are using a manifest list to support builds across multiple architectures, you can pin to the manifest list hash instead of a single image hash.

See [main.yaml](https://github.com/ossf/scorecard/blob/f55b86d6627cc3717e3a0395e03305e81b9a09be/.github/workflows/main.yml#L27) for example. To determine the permissions needed for your workflows, you may use [StepSecurity's online tool](https://app.stepsecurity.io/secureworkflow/) by ticking the \"Pin actions to a full length commit SHA\". You may also tick the \"Restrict permissions for GITHUB_TOKEN\" to fix issues found by the Token-Permissions check.\n\n- To help update your dependencies after pinning them, use tools such as those listed for the dependency update tool check.\n\n\n\n**Severity**: Medium\n\n\n\n**Details**:\n\nRisk: `Medium` (possible compromised dependencies)\n\n\n\nThis check tries to determine if the project pins dependencies used during its build and release process.\n\nA \"pinned dependency\" is a dependency that is explicitly set to a specific hash instead of\n\nallowing a mutable version or range of versions. It\n\nis currently limited to repositories hosted on GitHub, and does not support\n\nother source hosting repositories (i.e., Forges).\n\n\n\nThe check works by looking for unpinned dependencies in Dockerfiles, shell scripts, and GitHub workflows\n\nwhich are used during the build and release process of a project.\n\nSpecial considerations for Go modules treat full semantic versions as pinned\n\ndue to how the Go tool verifies downloaded content against the hashes when anyone first downloaded the module.\n\n\n\nPinned dependencies reduce several security risks:\n\n\n\n  - They ensure that checking and deployment are all done with the same\n\n    software, reducing deployment risks, simplifying debugging, and enabling\n\n    reproducibility.\n\n  - They can help mitigate compromised dependencies from undermining the\n\n    security of the project (in the case where you've evaluated the pinned\n\n    dependency, you are confident it's not compromised, and a later version is\n\n    released that is compromised).\n\n  - They are one way to [counter dependency confusion (aka substitution) attacks](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/resources/3-ways-to-mitigate-risk-using-private-package-feeds/),\n\n    in which an application uses multiple feeds to acquire software packages (a\n\n    \"hybrid configuration\"), and attackers fool the user into using a malicious\n\n    package via a feed that was not expected for that package.\n\n\n\nHowever, pinning dependencies can inhibit software updates, either because of a\n\nsecurity vulnerability or because the pinned version is compromised. Mitigate\n\nthis risk by:\n\n\n\n  - using automated tools to notify applications when their dependencies are\n\n    outdated;\n\n  - quickly updating applications that do pin dependencies.\n\n\n\nFor projects hosted on GitHub, you can learn more about\n\ndependencies using the [GitHub dependency graph](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/supply-chain-security/understanding-your-software-supply-chain/about-the-dependency-graph).\n\n",

See [Dockerfile](https://github.com/ossf/scorecard/blob/main/cron/internal/worker/Dockerfile) for example.

For C/C++, check in the code from a trusted source and add a `README` on the specific version used (and the archive SHA hashes).\n\n- If your project is producing an application and the package manager supports lock files (e.g. `package-lock.json` for npm), make sure to check these in the source code as well. These files maintain signatures for the entire dependency tree and saves from future exploitation in case the package is compromised.\n\n- For Dockerfiles used in building and releasing your project, pin dependencies by hash. See [Dockerfile](https://github.com/ossf/scorecard/blob/main/cron/internal/worker/Dockerfile) for example. If you are using a manifest list to support builds across multiple architectures, you can pin to the manifest list hash instead of a single image hash. You can use a tool like [crane](https://github.com/google/go-containerregistry/blob/main/cmd/crane/README.md) to obtain the hash of the manifest list like in this [example](https://github.com/ossf/scorecard/issues/1773#issuecomment-1076699039).\n\n- For GitHub workflows used in building and releasing your project, pin dependencies by hash. See [main.yaml](https://github.com/ossf/scorecard/blob/f55b86d6627cc3717e3a0395e03305e81b9a09be/.github/workflows/main.yml#L27) for example. To determine the permissions needed for your workflows, you may use [StepSecurity's online tool](https://app.stepsecurity.io/secureworkflow/) by ticking the \"Pin actions to a full length commit SHA\". You may also tick the \"Restrict permissions for GITHUB_TOKEN\" to fix issues found by the Token-Permissions check.\n\n- To help update your dependencies after pinning them, use tools such as those listed for the dependency update tool check.\n\n\n\n**Severity**: Medium\n\n\n\n**Details**:\n\nRisk: `Medium` (possible compromised dependencies)\n\n\n\nThis check tries to determine if the project pins dependencies used during its build and release process.\n\nA \"pinned dependency\" is a dependency that is explicitly set to a specific hash instead of\n\nallowing a mutable version or range of versions. It\n\nis currently limited to repositories hosted on GitHub, and does not support\n\nother source hosting repositories (i.e., Forges).\n\n\n\nThe check works by looking for unpinned dependencies in Dockerfiles, shell scripts, and GitHub workflows\n\nwhich are used during the build and release process of a project.\n\nSpecial considerations for Go modules treat full semantic versions as pinned\n\ndue to how the Go tool verifies downloaded content against the hashes when anyone first downloaded the module.\n\n\n\nPinned dependencies reduce several security risks:\n\n\n\n  - They ensure that checking and deployment are all done with the same\n\n    software, reducing deployment risks, simplifying debugging, and enabling\n\n    reproducibility.\n\n  - They can help mitigate compromised dependencies from undermining the\n\n    security of the project (in the case where you've evaluated the pinned\n\n    dependency, you are confident it's not compromised, and a later version is\n\n    released that is compromised).\n\n  - They are one way to [counter dependency confusion (aka substitution) attacks](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/resources/3-ways-to-mitigate-risk-using-private-package-feeds/),\n\n    in which an application uses multiple feeds to acquire software packages (a\n\n    \"hybrid configuration\"), and attackers fool the user into using a malicious\n\n    package via a feed that was not expected for that package.\n\n\n\nHowever, pinning dependencies can inhibit software updates, either because of a\n\nsecurity vulnerability or because the pinned version is compromised. Mitigate\n\nthis risk by:\n\n\n\n  - using automated tools to notify applications when their dependencies are\n\n    outdated;\n\n  - quickly updating applications that do pin dependencies.\n\n\n\nFor projects hosted on GitHub, you can learn more about\n\ndependencies using the [GitHub dependency graph](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/supply-chain-security/understanding-your-software-supply-chain/about-the-dependency-graph).\n\n",

If\n\nthe provided token does not have admin access, the check will query the branch\n\nsettings accessible to non-admins and provide results based only on these settings.\n\nHowever, all of these settings are accessible via Repo Rules. `EnforceAdmins` is calculated slightly differently.\n\nThis setting is calculated as `false` if any [Bypass Actors](https://docs.github.com/repositories/configuring-branches-and-merges-in-your-repository/managing-rulesets/creating-rulesets-for-a-repository#granting-bypass-permissions-for-your-ruleset)\n\n are defined on any rule, regardless of if they are admins.\n\n\n\nDifferent types of branch protection protect against different risks:\n\n\n\n  - Require code review: \n\n    - requires at least one reviewer, which greatly\n\n    reduces the risk that a compromised contributor can inject malicious code.\n\n    Review also increases the likelihood that an unintentional vulnerability in\n\n    a contribution will be detected and fixed before the change is accepted.\n\n\n\n    - requiring two or more reviewers protects even more from the insider risk \n\n    whereby a compromised contributor can be used by an attacker to LGTM \n\n    the attacker PR and inject a malicious code as if it was legit.\n\n\n\n  - Prevent force push: prevents use of the `--force` command on public\n\n    branches, which overwrites code irrevocably. This protection prevents the\n\n    rewriting of public history without external notice.\n\n\n\n  - Require [status checks](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-pull-requests/collaborating-on-repositories-with-code-quality-features/about-status-checks):\n\n    ensures that all required CI tests are met before a change is accepted.\n\n\n\nAlthough requiring code review can greatly reduce the chance that\n\nunintentional or malicious code enters the \"main\" branch, it is not feasible for\n\nall projects, such as those that don't have many active participants. For more\n\ndiscussion, see [Code Reviews](https://github.com/ossf/scorecard/blob/main/docs/checks.md#code-review).\n\n\n\nAdditionally, in some cases these rules will need to be suspended. For example,\n\nif a past commit includes illegal content such as child pornography, it may be\n\nnecessary to use a force push to rewrite the history rather than simply hide the\n\ncommit.\n\n\n\nThis test has tiered scoring. Each tier must be fully satisfied to achieve points at the next tier. For example, if you fulfill the Tier 3 checks but do not fulfill all the Tier 2 checks, you will not receive any points for Tier 3.\n\n\n\nNote: If Scorecard is run without an administrative access token, the requirements that specify “For administrators” can be safely ignored, and scores will be determined as if all such requirements have been met.\n\n\n\nTier 1 Requirements (3/10 points):\n\n  - Prevent force push\n\n  - Prevent branch deletion\n\n\n\nTier 2 Requirements (6/10 points):\n\n  - Require at least 1 reviewer for approval before merging\n\n  - For administrators: Require branch to be up to date before merging\n\n  - For administrators: Require approval of the most recent reviewable push\n\n\n\nTier 3 Requirements (8/10 points):\n\n  - Require branch to pass at least 1 status check before merging\n\n\n\nTier 4 Requirements (9/10 points):\n\n  - Require at least 2 reviewers for approval before merging\n\n  - Require review from code owners\n\n\n\nTier 5 Requirements (10/10 points):\n\n  - For administrators: Dismiss stale reviews and approvals when new commits are pushed\n\n  - For administrators: Include administrator for review\n\n\n\nGitLab Integration Status:\n\n  - GitLab associates releases with commits and not with the branch.

It also\n\nperforms a similar check for reviews using\n\n[Prow](https://github.com/kubernetes/test-infra/tree/master/prow#readme) (labels\n\n\"lgtm\" or \"approved\") and [Gerrit](https://www.gerritcodereview.com/) (\"Reviewed-on\" and \"Reviewed-by\").\n\nIf recent changes are solely bot activity (e.g. Dependabot, Renovate bot, or custom bots),\n\nthe check returns inconclusively.\n\n\n\nScoring is leveled instead of proportional to make the check more predictable.\n\nIf any bot-originated changes are unreviewed, 3 points are deducted.
