An unescaped dash is interpreted as part of a range. For example, in the character class `[a-zA-Z0-9%=.,-_]` the last character range matches the 55 characters between `,` and `_` (both included), which overlaps with the range `[0-9]` and is clearly not intended by the writer.\n\n\n## Recommendation\nAvoid any confusion about which characters are included in the range by writing unambiguous regular expressions. Always check that character ranges match only the expected characters.\n\n\n## Example\nThe following example code is intended to check whether a string is a valid 6 digit hex color.\n\n```javascript\n\nfunction isValidHexColor(color) {\n    return /^#[0-9a-fA-f]{6}$/i.test(color);\n}\n\n```\nHowever, the `A-f` range is overly large and matches every uppercase character. It would parse a \"color\" like `#XXYYZZ` as valid.\n\nThe fix is to use an uppercase `A-F` range instead.\n\n```javascript\n\nfunction isValidHexColor(color) {\n    return /^#[0-9A-F]{6}$/i.test(color);\n}\n\n```\n\n## References\n* GitHub Advisory Database: [CVE-2021-42740: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a Command in Shell-quote](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-g4rg-993r-mgx7)\n* wh0.github.io: [Exploiting CVE-2021-42740](https://wh0.github.io/2021/10/28/shell-quote-rce-exploiting.html)\n* Yosuke Ota: [no-obscure-range](https://ota-meshi.github.io/eslint-plugin-regexp/rules/no-obscure-range.html)\n* Paul Boyd: [The regex \\[,-.\\]](https://pboyd.io/posts/comma-dash-dot/)\n* Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-20](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/20.html).\n",
